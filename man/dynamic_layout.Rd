\title{Dynamic graph layout}
\usage{
layout_as_dynamic(gList, alpha = 0.5, iter = 500, tol = 1e-04)
}
\arguments{
\item{gList}{list of igraph objects. Each network must contain the same set of nodes.}

\item{alpha}{weighting of reference layout. See details.}

\item{iter}{number of iterations during stress optimization}

\item{tol}{stopping criterion for stress optimization}
}
\value{
coordinates to be used layouting the graphs
}
\description{
Layout a series of networks.
}
\details{
The reference layout is calculated based on the union of all graphs. The parameter alpha controls the influence of the reference layout.
For alpha=1, only the reference layout is used and all graphs have the same layout. For alpha=0, the stress layout of each individual graph is used. Values inbetween interpolate between the two layouts.
