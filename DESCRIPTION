Title: Additional Layout Algorithms for Network Visualizations
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("David", "Schoch", email = "david.schoch@manchester.ac.uk", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Several new layout algorithms to visualize networks are provided which are not part of igraph. 
    Most are based on the concept of stress majorization. Some more specific algorithms allow to emphasize 
    hidden group structures in networks or focus on specific nodes.
