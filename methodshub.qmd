## Description
<!--
1. Provide a brief and exact description of the method clearly mentioning its purpose i.e., what the method does or aims to achieve in abstract terms (avoiding technical details).
2. The focus should be on explaining the method in a way that helps users with different levels of expertise understand what it does, without going into technical details. It should clearly describe what inputs are needed and what outputs can be expected.
3. Briefly explain the input and output of the method and its note worthy features.
4. Provide link(s) to related papers from the social science domain using the method or similar methods for solving social science research questions. 
5. In a separate paragraph, highlight the reproducibility aspect of the method providing details or references to the resources used by the method, the data used in building the pre-trained modules etc.
6. It should also discuss the decisions and parameters controlling the behavior of the method.

The package implements several new layout algorithms to visualize networks are provided which are not part of 'igraph'. 
Most are based on the concept of stress majorization by Gansner et al. (2004) <doi:10.1007/978-3-540-31843-9_25>. 
Some more specific algorithms allow the user to emphasize hidden group structures in networks or focus on specific nodes..

## Keywords

## Use Cases
<!--
1. The use cases section should contain a list of use cases relevant to the social sciences.
2. Each use case should start with a description of a task and then detail how one can use the method to assist in the task.
3. Each use case may list publications in which the use case occurs (e.g., in APA7 style, https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples).

Network visualization offers social scientists a powerful tool for analyzing relationships and interactions within digital traces. For instance, researchers studying online communities can use network visualization to map interactions on social media platforms, such as X or Reddit. By visualizing user interactions (like replies, mentions, or shared links), researchers can uncover patterns in information flow, identify influential users, and explore the formation of communities or echo chambers. Network visualization can reveal clusters of users who frequently engage with one another, suggesting tightly-knit subgroups with shared interests or beliefs. It also helps identify key influencers within these networks, who may play a critical role in spreading information or shaping public opinion. This analysis is particularly useful for understanding phenomena like misinformation spread, public discourse on sensitive topics, or the social dynamics of online activism, offering insights into how ideas and behaviors propagate through digital spaces.

## Input Data
<!--
1. The input data section should illustrate the input data format by showing a (possibly abbreviated) example item and explaining (or linking to an explanation of) the data fields.
2. The input data section should specify which parts of the input data are optional and what effect it has to not provide these.
3. The input data section should link to a small example input file in the same repository that can be used to test the method (this test should be described in the section "How to Use").
-->

`graphlayouts` accepts `igraph` network objects as input and includes many datasets that can be used to test the layout algorithms.

## Output Data
<!--
1. The output data section should illustrate the output data format by showing a (possibly abbreviated) example item and explaining (or linking to an explanation of) the data fields.
2. The output data section should link to a small example output file in the same repository that can be re-created (as far as the method is non-random) from the input data (as described in the section "How to Use").
-->

The output of `graphlayouts` is a layout object created with `create_layout()` from `ggraph`.  
This object is essentially a data frame that contains the x–y coordinates of each node, along with any node attributes from the input graph. It can be directly passed into plotting functions in `ggraph`.

## Environment Setup
<!--
1. The environment setup section should list all requirements and provide all further steps to prepare an environment for running the method (installing requirements, downloading files, creating directoriees, etc.).
2. The environment setup section should recommend to use a virtual environment or similar if the programming language supports one.
-->

With R installed:

```r
install.packages("graphlayouts")
```

## How to Use
<!--
1. The how to use section should provide the list of steps that are necessary to produce the example output file (see section Output Data) after having set up the environment (see section Environment Setup).
2. The how to use section should explain how to customize the steps to one's own needs, usually through configuration files or command line parameters, or refer to the appropriate open documentation.
-->

After installing the package and its dependencies you can start visualizing networks with `graphlayouts` and the `ggraph` plotting framework.  

### Create or load a graph
Graphs can be created manually or loaded from existing datasets. For example:  

```r
library(igraph)
g <- make_ring(10) # simple ring graph with 10 nodes
```

### Choose a layout algorithm
The core contribution of `graphlayouts` is a collection of layout algorithms not included in base `igraph`. Layouts are deterministic (they give the same result each time) and often based on *stress majorization*, which aims to preserve graph-theoretic distances in 2D space.  

Use `create_layout()` from `ggraph` with one of the following layout options provided by `graphlayouts`:
- `"stress"` – general-purpose layout that minimizes stress in node placement.  
- `"focus"` – emphasizes the position of one or more focal nodes.  
- `"backbone"` – highlights the backbone structure of a network while de-emphasizing weaker connections.  
- `"centrality"` – arranges nodes according to a chosen centrality measure (e.g., degree or betweenness).  

```r
library(graphlayouts)
library(ggraph)

lay <- create_layout(g, layout = "stress")
```

### Draw the network with `ggraph`
With a layout prepared, you can visualize the graph using `ggraph` layers.  

- **Nodes**: use `geom_node_point()` for basic dots, `geom_node_text()` for labels, or scale aesthetics (size, color, fill) by node attributes.  
- **Edges**: use `geom_edge_link()` for straight lines, `geom_edge_arc()` for curved arcs, or directional edges with arrows.  

```r
ggraph(lay) +
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_node_point(size = 5, color = "steelblue") +
  theme_graph()
```

### Customize appearance
You can customize almost every aspect of the plot:
- **Node size or color** can map to graph metrics:  

```r
V(g)$deg <- degree(g)
ggraph(lay) +
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = deg), color = "tomato") +
  theme_graph()
```

- **Edge thickness or color** can map to weights or categories.  
- **Labels** can be added with `geom_node_text()` or `geom_node_label()`.  
- **Themes and palettes**: use `theme_graph()` for a clean default or apply any ggplot2 scales (e.g., `scale_fill_viridis_c()`).  

### Explore alternatives
`graphlayouts` is particularly useful when different research questions call for different visual emphases:
- Use `"focus"` layouts to visualize networks from the perspective of a key actor.  
- Use `"backbone"` layouts to highlight community structures.  
- Compare multiple layouts to see how structural features (clusters, bridges, hubs) appear under different perspectives.
